********** Fizz Buzz Test **********

Description:
 - The algorithm was written in python.
 - There's is 2 versions of the algo, one is a more clean but extense and the other is shorter but more messy and probably a little faster
 - The if-else statements are organized from the most unlikely to the most likely condition


Execution:
 - To execute the code just install python 3 and run it throught the command line with 'python fizzbuzz.py' or open the algo with a python IDE,
	and the the console will print two list with the each version indicated


Reasons:
 - In first version I separated every condition because I think it's more easy to read, modify and reuse, but it makes the algo bigger.
 - The second version is basically straight to the point, has the same amount of if-else statements and loops as the previous version
	but the major difference is the size of the algo and the lack of reusability.
